        // Important Note :
        // Hoisting will only work with var.
        // It will not work with let or const.
        // Hoising also doesn't work with function expressions and class expressions.

        // Note :
        /* Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behaviour of JavaScript. If a 
        Developer doesn't understand hoisting, program may contain bugs (errors).
        To avoid bugs, always declare every variable at the beiginning of every scope.
        Since this is how JavaScript interprets code, it is always a good rule. */
